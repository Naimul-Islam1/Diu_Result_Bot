**Security Policy**

The Diu_Result_Bot development team takes user privacy and security very seriously. This security policy outlines the measures in place to protect user data:

* **Data Minimization:** The chatbot collects only the information necessary to function, such as the user's query.
* **Data Storage:** Any collected data is stored securely on authorized servers and is not accessible to unauthorized personnel.
* **Data Encryption:** Data transmission between the user and the chatbot is encrypted to prevent unauthorized interception.
* **Regular Updates:** The chatbot's software is regularly updated to address potential security vulnerabilities.

**Please note that this document details the intended security practices. Refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date security information.**
